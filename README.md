Perryâ€™s ID3 Tag Library
=======================

A free open-source ID3v1 and ID3v2 tag parsing utility for MP3 files. Programmed in VB.NET, it has been tested to work with Visual Studio, VB.NET, ASP.NET, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and VBScript.

-Supports ID3v1, ID3v2.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, ID3v2.4.  
-Object oriented architecture - MP3File, ID3v2Tag, Frame, mp3.Artwork, etc.  
-Meticulously built from scratch in accordance with official ID3 spec.  
-Detects ALL ID3v2 frames such as those typically hidden or ignored - PRIV, etc.  
-In the works: tag writing. Insert/edit/delete ANY ID3v2 frame.  
-Future plans for: batch processing, MPEG data (duration, bitrate, etc), filemeta/online/catalog auto-tagging.  

Perry's ID3 Tag Viewer implements the current version of the library:

However, the Viewer is currently not available as an open-source project for now...

History
=======

This project originated as a sub-component for an older project I started in 2010. Attempting to implement a full spec ID3 tag reader was a huge challenge for me (having zero binary knowledge at the time) but overall proved to be an incredible learning experience.
