Perryâ€™s ID3 Tag Library
=======================

A free open-source ID3v1 and ID3v2 tag parsing utility for MP3 files programmed in VB.NET. It has been tested to work with Visual Studio, VB.NET, ASP.NET, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and VBScript.

-Supports ID3v1, ID3v2.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, ID3v2.4.  
-Object oriented - MP3File, ID3v2Tag, Frame, etc.  
-Meticulously built from scratch in accordance with official ID3 spec.  
-Detects ALL ID3v2 frames such as those typically hidden or ignored - PRIV, etc.  
-In the works: tag writing. Insert/edit/delete ANY ID3v2 frame.  
-Future plans for: batch processing, MPEG data (duration, bitrate, etc), auto-tagging.  

Perry's ID3 Tag Viewer implements the current version of the library:
